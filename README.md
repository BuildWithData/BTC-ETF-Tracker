# ₿TC ETF TRACKER
On Jan 10th 2024 the SEC [approved](https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023)
a series of Bitcoin ETFs opening the floodgates to tradfi investors (eg Pension Funds), who did not have access to Bitcoin
yet and on 11th Jan ETFs started trading in what has been described by many as the Bitcoin IPO day.

The goal of this project is simple: **let <ins>ANYONE</ins> track Bitcoin ETFs with high quality data <ins>FOR FREE</ins>**

Sounds cool right !? But where do we get the data for free ?! ETF issuers
are required to publicly disclose financial data about their ETF products and
this is great news for us, because we can scrape those data from their websites.

## How To Use This If No CODING SKILLS 💻 🆘
You do not know how to code or you simply wanna just look at the dashboards ?

Just come back here in one week and you will find a dedicated [video tutorial](TODO) for you.

## How To Start 🚀
More detailed docs coming soon, meanwhile you can check the how to get started video [here](TODO).

## Data 📊
We started scraping data on Feb 23rd and you can find them [here](TODO).
Expect them to be updated at least once per week.

## How To Contribute 🤝
Any help is very much appreciated and welcomed because more has to come this year as the impact of Bitcoin ETFs
on tradfi has probably just started as we can read [here](https://docs.londonstockexchange.com/sites/default/files/documents/n0324.pdf).
